Documentation
=============
PocketMine-MP Documentation allows you to refer to the Documentation to find APIs instead of having to browse through the code to find different APIs. This is what I had to do and I(sekjun9878, the author of the documentation) would like to prevent other people having to do the same thing. 

Each API version is defined by the release of PocketMine.

If you can help this documentation improve, or have found typos, feel free to fork, and pull request your changes.
I will review every single one of them and pull request them if possible.
